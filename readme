## Introduction
MyShell is a simple shell program for educational purposes, supporting basic command-line operations.

## Features
- Internal commands: 
	-`cd` for changing the current working directory.
	-`clr` for clearing the screen.
	-`dir` for listing the contents of a directory.
	-`environ` for printing all the environment variables.
	-`echo` for printing a comment on the display.
	-`help` to display the user manual.
	-`pause` to pause operation of the shell.
	-`quit` to quit the shell.
- External commands.
	- After reading a command and determining its not an internal command, our shell uses `fork` to create a child process.
	- Our shell (the parent process) waits for the child process to finish executing before taking more user input. 
- Standard keyboard input.
- Batchfile input.
